Forward proxy and reverse proxy
--------------------------------
1. You can watch restricted content
2. You can change Geo location
3. client side proxy, only client is aware of proxy
4. Hiding client identity
5. Traffic monitor
6. Secure connections
7. Content access restriction
8. We can use it for cache purpose

Reverse Proxy
-------------------------
1. Only Server is aware of proxy
2. Security between clients and servers
3. as load balancer..
4. SSL termination

/etc/nginx/nginx.conf --> default conf
/usr/share/nginx/html
/var/log/nginx

include /etc/nginx/default.d/*.conf;

upstream backend {
      server 172.31.44.133; 
      server 172.31.38.145;
   }
   
proxy_http_version 1.1;

location / { proxy_pass http://upstream/; }

location /health {
  stub_status on;
  access_log off;
}

/usr/share/nginx/html --> default

IP or IP/ --> /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html

Linux folder structure
----------
/ --> root directory of the OS
/bin(binaries) --> essential commands are here. ls, cat, grep, etc.
/sbin(system binaries) --> admin commands, reboot, iptables, etc.
/boot --> when linux server started, it refers boot directory for system configuration
/dev(devices) --> monitor/terminal, keyboard, printers, etc.
/etc(extra configuration) --> system configuration files, service configurations, etc.
/home(home directory of users) --> all users directory are here, their personal files, user related configs..
/lib(Libraries) --> libraries/dependencies required by OS equal to .dll in windows
/lib64(64 bit libs)
/media(Media devices) --> CD, DVC, USB, etc.
/mnt(mount) --> adding extra disks
/opt(optional) --> if you want third party applications, custom applications you can keep here
/proc(processor) --> /proc/cpuinfo /proc/meminfo
/root (Root user) --> home directory of root user
/run (Running information of server)
/srv(service files) --> When you use your server to serve as file server, you can use this
/swap(Swap space) --> 1GM ram, OS will use this swap space for extension of RAM. Reserver space
/sys --> system kernal info, devices info, etc
/tmp --> temporary directory, not at all important
/usr --> shared files and docs between all users...
/var(variables) --> logs and messages

/etc
/opt
/var
/bin

Linux is completed 

Configuration
----------------------
1. Install application runtime --> nodejs, java, etc.
2. create a user
3. create a folder
4. download code
5. install dependencies
6. create systemctl services

free -m --> check ram usage
df -hT --> HD usage

keep all your commands in a file and run that file --> shell script

What is shell?

Shell is a interpreter in Linux, that checks and executes the users commands

/bin/bash --> interprets every command issued inside linux server

1. carry one by one to home
2. use a truck, keep everything inside and carry to home

if a command gives error, let us proceed or clear the error and proceed

when you run through program, it should be able to check previous command is success, if success proceed, if failure stop and inform user(error handling)

Algorithm
---------------
write steps in your own language what to do?

Install a pacakge through shell script??

check you have root access or not

if no root access, show the error

check if already installed or not, inform already installed

if not installed, install it

check success or not

git --> store scripts or programs
