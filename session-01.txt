What is DevOps?

School management system
-------------------------
50 year back
system = stakeholders == students, teachers, parents

100 --> 20 or 30% pass percentage

only one Final exam
-------------------
students --> they are not serious from DAY-1
teachers --> they are not serious to complete from DAY-1
parents --> they starts worry about their kids

pass percentage is very less


we need to change the process

30 year back
------------------------
unit tests, quarterly, half yearly, pre final

unit test-1 --> 1.5 month

students --> they are not serious from DAY-1, atleast they are serious from 1week before
teachers --> they are serious from DAY-1 to complete syllabus
parents --> they are serious from DAY-1

30% is pass in unit-1

parents, teachers starts understanding the student behaviour

unit test-2 --> 31%
unit test-3
quarterly
half yearly
prefinal
final --> 80%

10 years back
---------------
slip test
300 days
200 exams

99% pass percentage

SDLC --> Software development lifecycle

1. Requirements
2. Planning
3. Design
4. Developing
5. Deployment
6. Testing
7. Maintainance

Waterfall Model
------------------
fathers generation == Waterfall model

2 years time to complete

stakeholders = customers, developers, testers, managers, end users, etc.

developers --> are they serious from DAY-1
testers --> no they are not serious
clients --> they are worried from DAY-1

after 1 year they got seriousness

developers develop it in 6 months
deploy the application --> build and release in DEV

testers starting testing --> 100 defects
some are invalid --> 20 invalid defects

after 2 years, they release something --> maruti 800


Agile
-------------------------
Sprints --> Installment based based deliveries

modules -->
User management --> 1 months
	signup
	login
	forgot password
	change password

product management
	list the products
	prices
cart
	add to cart
shipping
	adding address
payment
order management

User management --> 1 months
15 days --> development
15 days --> testing and deployment

testing --> 30 defects
10 invalid defects

client test the user management --> 10 bugs

product management == clear the previous bugs and develop product management

ferrari == fortuner

DevOps with Agile
-----------------------
DAY-1

developer writes some code, the same day build(compile and pack) the code, test it

100 lines of code --> testing is simple
no of invalid defects are less
2 valid defects --> very easy to developer
Ops --> testing, build and release(DevOps)

We create a process called CICD with the help of tools, the same day we are able to build and test the application

DEV QA UAT PRE-PROD PERF PROD

1. Faster releases
2. Less defects

speed and accuracy

DevOps == Continous improvement
	DevSecOps --> added security inside it
	shift left
	GitOps --> Entire process should be in Git.

What is computer?
-----------------------
Can I call mobile as computer?
Can I call TV as computer?
Can I call Server as computer?

Software --> communication between computers

Facebook --> A group of computers/servers

Computer --> compute something, it can do some work

IP enabled device
-----------------
CPU(Procesor)
RAM
OS
ROM(Storage)

Server --> Deploy the application

Client and Server

Lawyer and Me

Lawyer --> Server (Serves someone)
Client --> Me

Browser --> Client
edge, chrome, firefox, opera, etc.

Which OS is suitable for Servers?
---------------------------------
Unix, Windows Server

not open source --> Only MS controls
graphics --> consumes resources(CPU, RAM) alot
Cost --> High
Security --> less
Speed --> less

clicks in windows --> commands --> Hardware

Why Azure services are down?

Even you are running Azure VM in Linux, still it is down. AKS MSSQL down
underlying azure infra is MS OS

Unix == Linux

Unix is hardware locked --> Mac Laptop == Mac OS + Mac Hardware

Dell --> Dell Hardware
OS you can choose anything

He built Linux from the scratch without lock, and released to public

Linux --> Ubuntu, Centos, Fedora, Solaris, Android, Redhat, etc.
commands --> Hardware

Redhat --> Enterprise, if you face any problem they will help us
Redhat == CentOS/Almalinux

Cloud and DevOps two wheels to a bike

AWS Account --> FREE(1 year free trail) --> 3,000(there is refund option)
------------
1. Use private banks
2. enable internation usage
3. enable online usage

first name and lastname should be as the bank debit/credit card name
address should be given same as in bank

Choose Personal account


Build errors
Deployment errors
Testing errors
