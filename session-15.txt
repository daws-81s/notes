Legacy
---------------
old technology
as part of our team, we are managing our legacy systems as well..
1. monitoring CPU and memory and sending alert emails
2. backup scripts and scheduled them

Configuration management
------------------------
server --> plain server with out anything installed

install app runtime and few packages
creating users and folder
downloading code
installing dependencies
creating systemctl services
copying config files

plain --> ready to serve the application/end user --> manual --> shell script

1. not idempotent --> write custom code to make it idempotent
2. error handling --> we need to write code to check the errors
3. Homogenous --> only works specific distro
4. not scalable when too many servers
5. syntax is not easy to understand

CM tools --> puppet, chef, rundeck, ansible, etc.

push vs pull
-------------

Courier Delhi --> Hyd

HYD DTDC

1. We go to HYD DTDC daily and check for courier --> pull
2. We sit in home, whenever courier comes to HYD DTDC, they deliver to us --> push

pull
---------
1. causing more traffic on roads --> more traffic in internet
2. unnecessary resources waste time, fuel, etc. --> bandwidth, power, device resources, etc.
3. cost

push
--------
save everything, ssh protocol

recently we migrated normal servers to ansible managed servers

54.210.150.96 --> /tmp/hello.txt

1. login to server
2. move to /tmp dir
3. create file
4. exit

earlier ansible was only on push based, but recently it implemented pull based also...

inventory
-------------
list of servers ansible is managing

1. are your ansible server able to reach node --> firewall configs,

install nginx on node from ansible

dnf install nginx -y

Linux/Shell --> command == Module in ansible
inputs and options

dnf  install  nginx -y
cmd  options   inputs

ansible -i 172.31.41.249, all -e ansilbe_user=ec2-user -e ansible_password=DevOps321 -m dnf -a "name=nginx state=installed"

-b --> become root

"changed": true,
    "msg": "",
    "rc": 0,
    "results": [
        "Installed: nginx-1:1.20.1-14.el9_2.1.x86_64",
        "Installed: nginx-filesystem-1:1.20.1-14.el9_2.1.noarch",
        "Installed: nginx-core-1:1.20.1-14.el9_2.1.x86_64",
        "Installed: redhat-logos-httpd-90.4-2.el9.noarch"
    ]

adhoc commands --> it is the command issued from ansible server targeting node manually, basically on some emergency/adhoc purpose

run the commands one by one in a sequence --> keep all those commands in a file with some syntax and run it at a time == shell scripting


run the commands one by one in a sequence  --> office laptop --> IN --> US

keep all those commands in a file with some syntax and run it at a time --> runs inside US server

playbooks --> Yet another markup language(YAML)
--------------
playbook is a list of modules ansible server runs againts its node...

XML vs JSON vs YAML
---------------

200 years back --> take a paper

1. ac id
2. date
3. amount
4. branch
5. ac name
6. denomination

sign it and give

ac name, date, ac id

templates --> cash deposit, cash withdrawal, gold, etc...

field name --> field value
key name --> key value

DTO --> data transfer objects
