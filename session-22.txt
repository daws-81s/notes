IAM users

Manual Infra
-----------------
Everything in console.... by mistake if someone edit wrong, then app will go down...30min-1hr
application restore back to previous stage if something goes wrong

Version control

Consistent Infra --> All environment configs and infra should be some..

CRUD --> Create infra, read, update, deleting the infra

Inventory/resource management --> If you see tf script, you know what are the services you are using

Cost optimisation --> creation in 5min, deletion in 5min

Dependency management --> sg, ec2 instance after creation of all dependencies

Code reuse --> Roles. Modules

Declarative way of creating infra --> You are giving orders to terraform to create infra just by providing right syntax

easy syntax
no sequence
state management --> Terraform can track what it created, can update easily

mysql --> mysqlll


HCL --> Hashicorp configuration language

Download terraform
keep terraform.exe in some folder
edit the environment variables, provide the path

aws configure --> AWS command line install

Resources

Terraform --> AWS, AZure, GCP, Alibaba, Digital Ocean, etc. GitHub, Networking, etc. These are the providers
----------
variables
data types
conditions
loops
functions
	data sources
	locals
	outputs
	providers
	provisoners
	
Create EC2 instance through terraform
-------------------------------------
terraform file extension is .tf

provider.tf --> where you can declare what provider you are using

resource "resource-type" "name-of-resource" {
	key = value
}

name
description
ingress mandatory
egress mandatory

ingress --> incoming traffic
egress --> outgoing traffic

while entering cabin you have to scan your ID...while exit the cabin just push the switch

terraform init --> intialise terraform, it will connect with provider and downloads it
keep .gitignore always

terraform plan --> cant create resources. it will just plan

terraform apply --> 

terraform apply -auto-approve
