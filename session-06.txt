Desktop appliactions

5min. I need to restart the sytem:

Disadvantages

Web based appliactions --> 3 tier architecture

Road side cart

He has to take care of cooking, billing, serving, ordering, cleaning, etc.
10 persons

hire someone

product taste and quality..

billing, serving he has to hire someone else

small hotel

user_id, user_name, first_name, last_name, password, created_date, dob
1         sivakumar  sivakumar   M         siva123    `9-AUG-2024   01-01-01

Chef == App server

username, password

through SQL queries, app server will check the data
CRUD

select * from user where user_name='sivakumar' and password='siva123'

WebServer --> put that into HTML format, so that a normal can easily format

{
	"user":"sivakumar",
	"dob":"01-01-01",
	"location":"bangalore"
}
